KALI Server/Client

A client / server interface for the UQDevices Timetagger16

Using cap'n'proto both for serialized data storage as well as for RPC communication between clients and server.

Very work in progress, the current implementation caps out @ 6ish MHz (the tagger is able to transfer 11MHz over USB2.0)

(Kali is the eponymous Hindu goddess of time)
